# tailscale-snap2
A Snap port of Tailscale.

This is a port of Tailscale to the Snap store. The snapcraft.yaml is based on the one by seriusens, found here: https://github.com/sergiusens/tailscale 

I also used AI to fix some of the snapcraft.yaml, because I am inexperienced with building Snaps.
Updates to the version of tailscale should not be needed because this version of Tailscale has a built-in updater, so theoretically, it should be fine.
